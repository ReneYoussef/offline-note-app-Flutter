# API Redirect Issue Fix

## Problem Summary

The app was experiencing **302 redirect errors** when syncing notes to the Render.com API. The errors manifested as:

```
Error syncing note [ID] to API: Exception: Base URL retry failed: 302 - [HTML redirect page]
```

### Root Causes

1. **Server Misconfiguration**: The Render.com server was responding with 302 redirects for POST/PUT requests, redirecting from:
   - `https://offline-note-app-api-1.onrender.com/api/notes` 
   - To: `https://offline-note-app-api-1.onrender.com` (base URL only, **losing the endpoint path**)

2. **Broken Retry Logic**: The old `_handleRedirectToBaseUrl()` method was reconstructing the **same URL**, so retries kept getting the same 302 response.

3. **HTTP Client Behavior**: The Dart `http.Client` doesn't automatically follow redirects for POST/PUT requests (only GET), so manual handling was required.

## Solution

### Changes Made to `api_services.dart`

1. **Removed Broken Code**:
   - Deleted `_retryWithHttpUrl()` method (unused)
   - Deleted `_handleRedirectToBaseUrl()` method (broken)
   - Removed unused `dart:io` import

2. **New Redirect Handler**: Created `_followRedirect()` method that:
   - Properly follows the `Location` header from redirect responses
   - **Detects when server strips the endpoint path** from redirect
   - Automatically reconstructs the correct URL: `{redirectLocation}/api{endpoint}`
   - Handles nested redirects (up to one more level)
   - Logs detailed information for debugging

3. **Updated Methods**:
   - `createNote()`: Now properly follows redirects with endpoint reconstruction
   - `updateNote()`: Now properly follows redirects with endpoint reconstruction  
   - `getNotes()`: Added redirect handling (though GET usually auto-follows)

### How the Fix Works

**Before (Broken)**:
```
POST https://offline-note-app-api-1.onrender.com/api/notes
→ 302 Redirect to: https://offline-note-app-api-1.onrender.com
→ Retry with same URL: https://offline-note-app-api-1.onrender.com/api/notes
→ 302 Redirect again (infinite loop)
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```
POST https://offline-note-app-api-1.onrender.com/api/notes
→ 302 Redirect to: https://offline-note-app-api-1.onrender.com
→ Detect missing endpoint, reconstruct: https://offline-note-app-api-1.onrender.com/api/notes
→ POST to reconstructed URL
→ 200 OK (Success!)
```

## Additional Protection: Infinite Loop Detection (Update #2)

After testing, it was discovered that the server has a **persistent redirect loop** - it keeps redirecting POST/PUT requests infinitely. Added protection:

### New Features:
1. **Redirect Limit**: Maximum of 2 redirects allowed
2. **Loop Detection**: Tracks attempted URLs to detect when server redirects to same URL
3. **Clear Error Messages**: Fails fast with actionable error message

### Error You'll See Now:
```
❌ Redirect loop detected! Already tried URL: [url]
Exception: Redirect loop detected. The server keeps redirecting to 
the same URL. This is a server configuration issue on Render.com 
that needs fixing.
```

This is **BETTER** than the previous behavior (infinite retries), but the **real solution** is fixing the server configuration.

## Testing

To verify the protection works:

1. **Run the app** on your Android device/emulator
2. **Try creating/updating notes** while connected to the internet
3. **Check the logs** for:
   - `⚠️ Server stripped endpoint from redirect, reconstructing: ...`
   - `❌ Redirect loop detected!` (if server still misconfigured)
   - App fails fast instead of hanging

## Long-term Recommendations

**⚠️ CRITICAL: The server is misconfigured and needs fixing!**

See **`SERVER_CONFIGURATION_ISSUE.md`** for detailed instructions on how to fix the Render.com server configuration.

### Quick Summary:
1. **Server is redirecting POST/PUT requests** (but not GET requests)
2. This causes an infinite redirect loop
3. The issue is on the **server side** (Render.com), not the Flutter app
4. Common causes:
   - HTTPS redirect middleware misconfigured
   - Trailing slash redirects enabled
   - Routes not properly configured for POST/PUT methods

### What You Need to Do:
1. Read `SERVER_CONFIGURATION_ISSUE.md` for full details
2. Fix your Render.com server configuration (see options in that file)
3. Test with `curl` to verify POST requests work without redirects
4. Once fixed, the app will work perfectly without any code changes needed
